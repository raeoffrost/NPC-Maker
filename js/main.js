    - **Global Event Handling**: Setting up event listeners for various buttons on the page.
    - **Additional Form Interactions**: Handling interactions such as recommending values, randomizing all values, and saving NPCs.
    - **Centralized Initialization Logic**: Ensuring that these event listeners were set up once the DOM content was fully loaded.
    
    Here is a summary of the key functionalities we can implement here in `main.js`:
    
    1. **Recommended Values Button**:
       - Selector: `.btn-primary:nth-child(1)`
       - Action: Log a message indicating recommended values were selected.
    
    2. **Randomize All Values Button**:
       - Selector: `.btn-primary:nth-child(2)`
       - Action: Log a message indicating all values were randomized.
    
    3. **Save NPC Button**:
       - Selector: `.saveNPC`
       - Action: Log a message indicating the NPC was saved.
